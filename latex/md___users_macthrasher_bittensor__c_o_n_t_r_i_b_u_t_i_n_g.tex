Bittensor is still in the Alpha stages, and as such you will likely run into some problems in deploying your model or installing Bittensor itself. If you run into an issue or resolve an issue yourself, feel free to create a pull request with a fix or with a fix to the documentation. The documentation repository can be found \href{https://github.com/opentensor/opentensor.github.io}{\texttt{ here}}.

Additionally, note that the entire implementation of Bittensor cnosists of two separate repositories\+: \href{https://github.com/opentensor/bittensor}{\texttt{ The core Bittensor code}} and the Bittensor Blockchain \href{https://github.com/opentensor/subtensor}{\texttt{ subtensor}}.\hypertarget{md___users_macthrasher_bittensor__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md42}{}\doxysection{How Can I Contribute?}\label{md___users_macthrasher_bittensor__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md42}
